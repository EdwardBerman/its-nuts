# Year of Extraversion

## Why Extraversion?

I don't want to be complacent. I have a lot of great friends. Extraversion doesn't have to mean make new friends. It can be as simple as making the extra effort to 
1. Text first. About a book you thought they might like, something in their personal life, a cool butterfly you saw, anything really. Just something to know that you are thinking of them. 
2. Do fun stuff. Go outside. No, really, go outside. While it is certainly nice and convenient to able to be able to reach your friends from anywhere, it is not healthy to substitute online interaction completely with exploring what life has to offer \*

I'd also like to meet some new friends. I go to a large university, it would be a waste of an oppurtunity not to attend different clubs and keep in touch with all of the different people I have met. Reallistically i can't stay friends with everyone, but I can certainly try to create as many meaningful connections as possible.

\* (Gas Prices and other travel expenses aside. If you live in the middle of nowhere, socializing is noticably harder. We love urbanism and hate the suburban dystopia).
